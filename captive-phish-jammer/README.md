# Captive Phish Jammer 🛡️🌟

An offensive-educational tool to defend against malicious captive portals (like those generated by Flipper Zero or WiFi Pineapple). Once connected to a suspicious Wi-Fi network, this script analyzes the captive portal, detects phishing forms, and floods them with randomized submissions to overwhelm the attacker.

## 🚀 Features

- Detects suspicious captive portals by parsing HTML.
- Automatically extracts and analyzes login forms.
- Launches multiple asynchronous POST submissions (default: 10).
- Uses randomized fake credentials and a pool of funny/random user-agents (including a fridge and a toaster).
- Fully asynchronous with `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for maximum speed.

## 💪 Dependencies

Before running the script, make sure you have Python 3 installed, and install these system packages:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv
```

## 🚧 Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youruser/captive-phish-jammer.git
cd captive-phish-jammer
```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install aiohttp beautifulsoup4
```

## 🔧 Usage

1. Open the `captive_phish_jammer.py` script and set the `PORTAL_TEST_URL` variable to the suspicious captive portal's URL (usually your browser will redirect to it when connecting):

```python
PORTAL_TEST_URL = "http://192.168.0.1"  # Example
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python captive_phish_jammer.py
```

3. The script will:
   - Download and parse the page
   - Extract the first form found (if any)
   - Send multiple randomized POST submissions using various user-agents

## 🏖️ About

Captive Phish Jammer is inspired by the need for active, automated countermeasures in hostile network environments. Its primary purpose is to test, analyze, and disrupt unauthorized phishing portals that exploit captive Wi-Fi setups.
